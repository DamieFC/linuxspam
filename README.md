# linuxspam
A place for people to spam pull requests so they will stop vandalizing the Linux kernel. I'll put some references to spam pull requests below and I'll implement them.
1. [#764-Update panic.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/764)
2. [#765-Merry Christmas!!](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/765)
## Why I did this
See, I am kinda strange in the way that I respect spam. I do, I respect the humor, but it really isn't right. So, instead of people spamming the actual Linux kernel, they can spam this, and not get in trouble.
